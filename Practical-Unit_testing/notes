using test doubles instead of creating real object :
Use Mockito.mock(Car.class) when you want to isolate the code under test, control the behavior of dependencies, and verify interactions with those dependencies.
Use an actual object of the Car class when you want to test the real behavior of the Car class and its interactions with other classes.
