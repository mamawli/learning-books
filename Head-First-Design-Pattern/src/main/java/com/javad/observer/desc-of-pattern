The Observer pattern is a design pattern that allows an object, known as the subject, to maintain a list of its dependents, called observers, and automatically notify them of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods. It's primarily used to implement distributed event handling systems.

Imagine you're building a weather monitoring application. At its core, you have a WeatherStation object that tracks temperature, humidity, and pressure. Different parts of the application might want to respond to changes in the weather data: for instance, a CurrentConditionsDisplay updates the current conditions, a StatisticsDisplay shows weather statistics, and a ForecastDisplay predicts the next day's weather.

In a poorly designed system, the WeatherStation would need to know about every display type and explicitly call a method on each one whenever the weather updates. This tightly couples the WeatherStation to the display modules, making the system harder to extend, modify, or maintain.

The Observer pattern elegantly solves this problem by decoupling the WeatherStation from the displays. The WeatherStation becomes the subject, and the displays are observers. The WeatherStation maintains a list of observers and broadcasts updates to them without needing to know their specific types or methods.

Here's how it works:

Observer Interface: This defines a method, such as update(), that observers must implement to receive updates from the subject.
Subject Interface: This defines methods for attaching, detaching, and notifying observers. The WeatherStation will implement this interface.
Concrete Observers: These are the display elements (CurrentConditionsDisplay, StatisticsDisplay, ForecastDisplay) that implement the Observer interface. When update() is called, they react to the new weather data in their specific way.
Concrete Subject: The WeatherStation implements the Subject interface, maintaining a list of observers and notifying them of changes.
To add a new display type, you simply create a new observer class that implements the Observer interface. No changes are needed to the WeatherStation (subject), adhering to the open-closed principle. Similarly, if a display is no longer required, it can be removed without impacting the WeatherStation or other displays. This pattern provides a flexible and scalable way to handle inter-object communication, making your code more maintainable and extensible.
