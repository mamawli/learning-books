Adapter pattern :
    A good example of adapter is that when you buy a laptop that made in US the charger Adapter have faze and null
    But when you wanna use this in britain the outlets have faze and null and earth . so you need an Adapter to
    change U.S interface to british interface ;

The Adapter Pattern converts the interface of a class into another interface the clients expect.
 Adapter lets classes work together that couldnâ€™t otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.
